# Documentation Update - October 21, 2025

## What Was Fixed

Updated all Isaac documentation files to ensure crystal clear, consistent command structure based on the actual design vision.

## Files Updated

1. **copilot-instructions.md** - Main reference for AI agents
2. **ISAAC_FINAL_DESIGN.md** - Overall architecture document
3. **ISAAC_UI_SPECIFICATION.md** - UI and command reference
4. **ISAAC_AI_INTERACTION_DESIGN.md** - AI interaction patterns

## New File Created

- **COMMAND_PATTERNS.md** - Authoritative command reference with real interaction examples

## Key Standardizations

### Command Prefixes

**ALL internal Isaac commands use `/` prefix:**
- `/help`, `/config`, `/status`, `/ask`, `/task`, `/collect`, `/debug`, `/msg`, `/f`, `/clear`, `/exit`, `/quit`

**ALL device routing uses `!` prefix:**
- `/msg !laptop2 "text"`
- `/show-cmd !desktop3`

**Natural language uses `isaac` prefix:**
- `isaac <query>` works in both external and internal modes
- Plain queries without 'isaac' get sass: "I have a name, use it."

### Mode Separation

**External Mode (before `isaac /start`):**
- Syntax: `isaac /command [args]`
- Limited commands: `/ask`, `/move`, `/start`, `/help`
- Internal-only commands blocked for safety

**Internal Mode (after `isaac /start`):**
- Prompt: `$>`
- All `/commands` available
- Natural language with `isaac <query>` or sass for invalid queries
- Shell commands (no prefix) go through tier validation

### Special Commands

**Force Command (`/f`):**
- Bypasses tier validation
- Internal-only for safety
- Example: `$> /f rm dangerous-file`

**Task Mode:**
- External: `isaac /task <description>`
- Internal: `/task <description>`

### Personality Responses

- Invalid query: "I have a name, use it."
- Canceled dangerous command: "saved your dumbass"
- Context-aware clarifications
- Exit message: "Isaac's outtie 5000 ! See ya!"

## Why This Matters

1. **Consistency** - All docs now use the same command patterns
2. **Clarity** - No ambiguity about which commands use which prefixes
3. **Safety** - Clear separation between external (restricted) and internal (full access) modes
4. **Developer Experience** - AI agents and developers have authoritative reference
5. **User Experience** - Predictable, memorable command structure

## Reference for Implementers

When implementing command routing, refer to:
- **COMMAND_PATTERNS.md** for exact interaction examples
- **copilot-instructions.md** for quick reference
- **ISAAC_FINAL_DESIGN.md** for architecture context

## Next Steps

1. Implement command router to enforce these patterns
2. Add external mode restrictions
3. Implement device routing with `!` prefix
4. Add personality responses
5. Test all command patterns from COMMAND_PATTERNS.md
