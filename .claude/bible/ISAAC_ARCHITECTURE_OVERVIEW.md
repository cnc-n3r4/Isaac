# ISAAC Architecture Overview

## System Components

ISAAC is a multi-platform AI-enhanced shell assistant built with a modular, safety-first architecture.

### Core Architectural Principles

1. **Safety First**: All commands pass through tiered validation
2. **Explicit Intent**: Clear distinction between AI chat and shell commands
3. **Streaming Intelligence**: Only streams when contextually safe
4. **Session Awareness**: Persistent state across usage sessions
5. **Plugin Extensibility**: Command system built on manifests

## Architecture Flow Charts

### 1. Command Routing Architecture
**File**: `COMMAND_ROUTING_ARCHITECTURE.md`
**Purpose**: Central nervous system for command processing
**Key Flow**: Input → Classification → Safety → Execution

### 2. Streaming Decision Architecture
**File**: `STREAMING_ARCHITECTURE.md`
**Purpose**: When AI responses can stream vs require sync processing
**Key Rule**: `/ask`/`/a` without pipes = stream, everything else = sync

### 3. Mining System Architecture
**File**: `MINING_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`
**Purpose**: xAI collections management with mining metaphor
**Key Flow**: Stake → Claim → Muck → Dig → Pan → Nuggets → Haul

### 4. Session Management Architecture
**File**: `SESSION_MANAGEMENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`
**Purpose**: Persistence, cloud sync, and state management
**Key Features**: Multi-layer data storage, conflict resolution, offline mode

### 5. System Startup Architecture
**File**: `SYSTEM_STARTUP_ARCHITECTURE.md`
**Purpose**: Complete initialization sequence and error handling
**Key Flow**: Config → Session → Components → Connectivity → Ready

## Data Flow Architecture

```
User Input
    │
    ├── ISAAC Commands (/xxx)
    │   ├── Meta commands (/help, /status)
    │   ├── AI commands (/ask, /a) → Streaming eligible
    │   ├── Mining commands (/mine) → Collection management
    │   └── Plugin commands → Extensible system
    │
    └── Shell Commands
        ├── Tier classification (1-4 safety levels)
        ├── AI validation (tiers 3+)
        └── Shell execution (PowerShell/Bash)
        │
        └── Results
            ├── Success → Display + session logging
            ├── Error → Safe handling + user feedback
            └── Pipeline → Data flow to next command
```

## Safety Architecture

```
Command Safety Layers:
├── Input Validation
│   ├── Syntax checking
│   ├── Path safety
│   └── Resource limits
│
├── Tier Classification
│   ├── Tier 1: Instant (ls, cd)
│   ├── Tier 2: Auto-correct (grep, head)
│   ├── Tier 3: AI validation (cp, mv)
│   └── Tier 4: Explicit confirm (rm, dd)
│
├── Execution Safety
│   ├── Sandboxed execution
│   ├── Timeout protection
│   └── Error containment
│
└── Result Validation
    ├── Output sanitization
    ├── Size limits
    └── Content filtering
```

## Streaming Architecture

```
Streaming Decision Tree:
User Input
├── Is /ask or /a command?
│   ├── YES → Check for pipes
│   │   ├── Has | pipe → SYNC (data processing)
│   │   └── No pipe → STREAM (AI chat)
│   └── NO → SYNC (potential shell command)
└── Result: Safe streaming only when intent is explicit
```

## Session Architecture

```
Session Data Layers:
├── Configuration (user preferences, API keys)
├── Command History (executed commands + results)
├── AI Query History (AI interactions + metadata)
├── Task History (multi-step operations + recovery)
└── Mining State (active collections, nuggets)

Cloud Sync:
├── Automatic background sync
├── Conflict resolution
├── Offline queue management
└── Cross-device availability
```

## Component Integration

```
ISAAC Components:
├── Command Router (central dispatcher)
├── Session Manager (state + persistence)
├── Shell Adapters (PowerShell/Bash abstraction)
├── AI Clients (xAI integration)
├── Plugin System (extensible commands)
├── UI Layer (terminal interface)
└── Cloud Client (GoDaddy API sync)
```

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Explicit AI Intent
- `/ask` and `/a` clearly signal AI interaction
- Prevents accidental streaming of shell commands
- Enables safe streaming for chat scenarios

### 2. Tiered Safety System
- Progressive validation based on command risk
- Balances usability with safety
- Allows efficient processing of safe commands

### 3. Mining Metaphor
- Makes complex collection operations intuitive
- Provides clear mental model for file management
- Extensible vocabulary for future features

### 4. Session-Centric Design
- All state managed through session system
- Enables cloud sync and cross-session continuity
- Provides audit trail and recovery options

### 5. Plugin Architecture
- Commands defined by YAML manifests
- Supports aliases and multiple triggers
- Enables community extensions

## Future Architecture Directions

```
Planned Enhancements:
├── Advanced streaming (progress bars, cancellation)
├── Multi-user collaboration features
├── Enhanced AI integration (models, tools)
├── Performance optimizations (caching, async)
├── Advanced mining features (analytics, sharing)
└── Mobile/web companion interfaces
