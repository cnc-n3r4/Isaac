# Manual Cleanup Required

## Completed Items to Remove
The following files have been completed (duplicates exist in `/instructions/`) and should be manually deleted from `.claude/mail/to_implement/`:

- `mvp_config_console_spec.md`
- `piping_system_phase1.md`
- `streaming_spinner_enhancement.md`

## Process
1. Verify the implementations are working correctly
2. Delete the files from `.claude/mail/to_implement/`
3. The tally sheet has been updated to reflect completion

## Next Steps
- Focus on high-priority items: command syntax standardization, /ask implementation, UI import fixes
- Continue the workflow: create specs → copy to /instructions → implement → cleanup
