# Chat History Memory - Implementation Fix

## Issue
Chat history memory implementation incomplete. User tested and it didn't work.

## Root Cause (DIAGNOSED)
**AI query history is never persisted to disk.**

Each `/ask` command:
1. Creates fresh SessionManager
2. Adds query to `ai_query_history` (in-memory list)
3. Exits - history lost

Next `/ask` starts with empty history again.

## What Was Done
- Modified `_build_chat_preprompt()` in `isaac/commands/ask/run.py` to accept `current_query` parameter
- Added history retrieval logic: `session.ai_query_history.get_recent(count=5)`
- Added conversation formatting into preprompt
- Fixed attribute name typo: `aiquery_history` â†’ `ai_query_history`

## What's Missing
**Persistence layer for AIQueryHistory:**

1. `SessionManager.__init__()` needs to load `~/.isaac/aiquery_history.json` on startup
2. `SessionManager.log_ai_query()` needs to save to disk after adding entry
3. Optional: Cloud sync like command_history.json

## Implementation Needed
In `isaac/core/session_manager.py`:

**Add to `__init__()`:**
```python
# Load AI query history from disk
history_file = self.config_dir / 'aiquery_history.json'
if history_file.exists():
    with open(history_file, 'r') as f:
        data = json.load(f)
        self.ai_query_history.queries = data.get('queries', [])
```

**Add to `log_ai_query()`:**
```python
# Save to disk after adding
history_file = self.config_dir / 'aiquery_history.json'
with open(history_file, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(self.ai_query_history.to_dict(), f, indent=2)

# Optional: Cloud sync
if self.cloud and self.cloud.is_available():
    self.cloud.save_session_file('aiquery_history.json', self.ai_query_history.to_dict())
```

## Files Involved
- `isaac/commands/ask/run.py` (lines 90-180 approx)
- `isaac/models/aiquery_history.py`
- `isaac/core/session_manager.py` (line 74: `self.ai_query_history`)

## Test Case
```powershell
isaac /start
/ask where is iowa?
/ask what did I just ask you?  # Should reference Iowa question
```

## Complexity: Low
Straightforward persistence implementation - follow command_history pattern.

## Priority: HIGH
Blocking user from testing conversational memory features.

**For Coding Agent:** Implement persistence for AIQueryHistory following the same pattern as command_history in SessionManager. Load on init, save on log_ai_query(). Test with provided test case.</content>
