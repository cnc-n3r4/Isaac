# /save Command Retirement Decision

**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Decision:** Remove `/save` command from Phase 1 piping system
**Reason:** Notes were getting mixed up with file-based storage

## Context
The `/save` command was originally designed to write piped blob content directly to files. However, this created confusion with note/workspace management.

## Better Solution
`/mine cast` and `/mine dig` provide superior workspace/note management:
- **Semantic storage:** Content stored in xAI Collections with semantic search
- **Organized:** Collections keep related notes together
- **Searchable:** `/mine dig` finds content by meaning, not just keywords
- **Cloud-backed:** Persistent across sessions and machines

## Migration Path
Instead of:
```bash
/ask "kubernetes" | /save notes.md
```

Use:
```bash
/ask "kubernetes" | /mine cast k8s_notes
/mine dig "kubernetes concepts"
```

## Files Updated
- `CURRENT_FOCUS.md` - Removed `/save` from Phase 1 components
- `IMPLEMENTATION_TALLY_SHEET.md` - Updated to reflect collections-based approach
- `/save` command remains unimplemented (no manifest file)
