I'm happy to provide an expansive history of Russia, covering its major historical periods, key events, and cultural developments. Given the depth of this topic, I’ll structure the response to cover the origins of Russia, its major eras, and significant turning points up to the modern day. Let's dive into the history of one of the world’s largest and most influential nations.

### Early History and the Formation of Kievan Rus' (9th–13th Centuries)
The history of Russia begins with the East Slavic tribes in Eastern Europe. By the 9th century, these tribes inhabited the vast plains and forests of what is now western Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. The first significant political entity in the region was Kievan Rus', a federation of Slavic tribes and Scandinavian Varangians (Vikings) centered in the city of Kiev (now in Ukraine). According to the *Primary Chronicle*, a key historical text compiled by the monk Nestor in the early 12th century, the Varangian prince Rurik was invited to rule over the city of Novgorod in 862, marking the traditional founding of Rus'. His successors, including Oleg of Novgorod, moved the capital to Kiev in 882, establishing it as the heart of a burgeoning state.

Kievan Rus' became a major regional power under leaders like Vladimir the Great (r. 980–1015), who converted to Byzantine Christianity in 988, an event that shaped Russian culture and tied it to the Orthodox Christian world. His son, Yaroslav the Wise (r. 1019–1054), oversaw a golden age of cultural and architectural development, including the construction of the iconic Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev. However, after Yaroslav’s death, internal divisions weakened Kievan Rus', and it fragmented into smaller principalities. The final blow came with the Mongol invasion in the 13th century, beginning with the destruction of Kiev in 1240 by Batu Khan, a grandson of Genghis Khan.

### The Mongol Yoke and the Rise of Muscovy (13th–15th Centuries)
From the 1240s onward, much of the former Kievan Rus' territories fell under the control of the Mongol Golden Horde, a period often referred to as the "Mongol Yoke." The Mongols exacted tribute and exerted political influence, but they allowed local princes to govern under their oversight. During this time, the northern city of Novgorod escaped direct Mongol rule and maintained a degree of autonomy, while the small principality of Moscow (Muscovy) began to emerge as a regional power.

Moscow’s rise was largely due to the strategic leadership of its princes, who cooperated with the Mongols to gain favor. Ivan I Kalita ("Moneybag," r. 1325–1340) secured the title of Grand Prince and the right to collect tribute for the Mongols, enriching Moscow. Over time, Muscovy expanded its territory and influence. A turning point came under Dmitry Donskoy (r. 1359–1389), who defeated the Mongols at the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380, a symbolic victory that boosted Moscow’s prestige, though Mongol dominance persisted for another century. The Mongol Yoke officially ended in 1480 under Ivan III Vasilyevich ("the Great," r. 1462–1505), when he refused to pay tribute, and the Mongols did not retaliate. Ivan III also began the process of "gathering the Russian lands," annexing rival principalities like Novgorod and Tver, and adopting the title "Tsar of All Rus'," signaling his ambition to unify the region.

### The Tsardom of Russia (1547–1613)
In 1547, Ivan IV Vasilyevich, known as Ivan the Terrible (r. 1547–1584), was crowned the first Tsar of Russia, marking the formal establishment of the Tsardom of Russia. Ivan’s reign was a complex mix of expansion and brutality. He conquered the Khanates of Kazan (1552) and Astrakhan (1556), expanding Russian territory into the Volga region and opening the door to Siberia. However, his later years were marked by paranoia and violence, including the oprichnina, a period of state terror (1565–1572) during which he purged perceived enemies, devastating the nobility and peasantry alike. His death in 1584 left Russia in disarray, compounded by the lack of a clear heir after the death of his son Fyodor.

The late 16th and early 17th centuries saw the Time of Troubles (1598–1613), a chaotic interregnum marked by famine, foreign intervention, and competing claims to the throne. Poland-Lithuania occupied Moscow, and impostors claiming to be Ivan the Terrible’s deceased son Dmitry (the False Dmitrys) further destabilized the country. This crisis ended with the election of Mikhail Fyodorovich Romanov as ts
