From the provided collection, the data includes two entries related to Madonna's albums or EPs. To determine the "highest charting album," I am interpreting the numbering in the folder names (e.g., "33 (1991)" and "60 (2000)") as potential indicators of chart positions, since no explicit chart data is provided in the file names or paths.

- The first entry is "Holiday (EP)" from 1991, with a folder name prefix of "33 (1991)", which may suggest a chart position of 33.
- The second entry is "Music (CD1) and (CD2)" from 2000, with a folder name prefix of "60 (2000)", which may suggest a chart position of 60.

Given this interpretation, "Holiday (EP)" from 1991 appears to be the higher charting release in this collection, with a potential chart position of 33 compared to "Music" at 60. Therefore, Madonna's highest charting album from this collection is likely "Holiday (EP)" from 1991.

Note: This analysis assumes the numerical prefixes in the folder names reflect chart positions. If this is not the case, the data provided does not contain explicit information about chart performance to make a definitive determination.
