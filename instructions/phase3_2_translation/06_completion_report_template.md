# Completion Report Template: Phase 3.2 Translation

## 🎯 Purpose

After implementing AI translation, VS Code agent fills out this report.

**Location (relative to workspace root):**
```
/instructions/from-agent/phase3_2_translation/COMPLETION_REPORT.md
```

## 📋 Report Template

**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Implementer:** [Agent Name/Version]  
**Duration:** [Actual hours spent]

## ✅ Implementation Status

### Files Created
- [ ] isaac/ai/translator.py - Translation logic (~100 lines)
- [ ] isaac/models/aiquery_history.py - AI query tracking (~60 lines)

### Files Modified
- [ ] isaac/core/command_router.py - Lines 46-53 replaced with translation logic
- [ ] isaac/core/session_manager.py - Added ai_query_history, log_ai_query()

### Integration Complete
- [ ] AI queries detected ("isaac " prefix)
- [ ] Translated commands route through tier system
- [ ] AI queries logged separately from shell commands
- [ ] Graceful degradation if AI disabled
