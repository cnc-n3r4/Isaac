dependencies:
  required:
    - "Phase 3.1 complete (ClaudeClient working)"
  
  files_needed:
    - "isaac/ai/claude_client.py"
    - "isaac/core/command_router.py"
    - "isaac/core/session_manager.py"

success_criteria:
  - "isaac find large files" translates to valid command
  - Translated commands go through tier validation
  - AI queries logged separately (private history)
  - Graceful fallback if AI fails

notes:
  - "All AI translations MUST go through tier system for safety"
  - "AI query history separate from command history"
  - "Privacy: AI queries marked as PRIVATE (no sync to debug bots)"
