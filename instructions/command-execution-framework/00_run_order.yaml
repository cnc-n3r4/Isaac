# Verification checkpoints:
checkpoints:
  - after: 02_command_router_impl.md
    verify: CommandRouter class exists and imports successfully
    
  - after: 06_help_handler_impl.md
    verify: All handlers in commands/ package
    
  - after: 07_repl_integration_impl.md
    verify: "isaac" command enters REPL with isaac> prompt
    
  - after: 08_ai_translation_impl.md
    verify: Natural language commands translate to actual paths

# Final validation:
final_tests:
  - test: isaac backup my-folder
    expected: Prompts for destination, executes backup
    
  - test: isaac (no args)
    expected: Enters REPL mode with isaac> prompt
    
  - test: isaac --help
    expected: Shows scannable command list
    
  - test: Natural language in REPL
    expected: AI translates to executable command with confirmation

# Notes:
notes: |
  - All handlers must integrate with existing SessionManager
  - Error messages must include suggestions
  - All commands logged (success/fail/cancelled)
  - REPL uses simple "isaac>" prompt
  - AI translation layer is critical for path resolution
