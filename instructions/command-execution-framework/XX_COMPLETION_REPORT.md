## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] CLI mode executes commands and exits
- [ ] REPL mode provides interactive loop
- [ ] Natural language translation (placeholder) works
- [ ] Explicit backup targets required
- [ ] Helpful error messages with suggestions
- [ ] Complete command logging (success/fail/cancelled)
- [ ] Scannable help system (‚â§30 lines)

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] No syntax errors
- [ ] All imports work
- [ ] CommandRouter instantiates correctly
- [ ] Handlers integrate with SessionManager
- [ ] REPL handles Ctrl+C and Ctrl+D gracefully
- [ ] Status symbols display correctly (‚úì/‚úó/‚äò)

### User Experience
- [ ] Simple `isaac>` prompt in REPL
- [ ] AI translation preview shown before execution
- [ ] Error messages include suggestions
- [ ] Exit commands work as expected
- [ ] Help output is scannable

### Known Limitations
- [ ] AI translation uses heuristics (Phase 3 for full AI)
- [ ] List history shows placeholder data (SessionManager integration needed)
- [ ] List backups shows placeholder data (backup tracking needed)
- [ ] Shell command execution not yet implemented

**Ready for Production:** [YES/NO]  
**Ready for Phase 3 (AI Integration):** [YES/NO]

## üìù Notes for Future Work

### Phase 3 Dependencies
**What Phase 3 (AI Integration) needs:**
- Working command execution framework (provided by this phase)
- Command router with natural language handling (placeholder in place)
- SessionManager integration for learning (logging in place)
- Handler architecture for extensibility (established)

### Improvements Needed
**Before Phase 3:**
- [ ] SessionManager: Add actual history storage
- [ ] SessionManager: Add backup metadata tracking
- [ ] Shell command execution integration
- [ ] Progress indicators for long-running backups

**Phase 3 AI Integration:**
- [ ] Replace AITranslator placeholder with LLM API
- [ ] Implement learning system from user feedback
- [ ] Add context management for better translations
- [ ] Improve path resolution with AI reasoning

### Architectural Concerns
**Points to address:**
- Command router lazy-loads handlers to avoid circular imports (working, but could be cleaner)
- AI translation placeholder provides interface but limited functionality
- SessionManager needs methods for history retrieval and backup tracking
- REPL error handling is comprehensive but may need refinement based on real-world usage

## üéâ Summary

[Brief paragraph summarizing:]
- Implementation experience
- What worked well
- What was challenging
- Overall assessment of readiness for Phase 3
- Any blockers or concerns

**Example:**
"Implemented complete command execution framework with 7 new files and 1 modified file. CommandRouter architecture provides clean separation between parsing, routing, and execution. All handlers integrate successfully with SessionManager logging. REPL loop is robust with comprehensive error handling. AI translation placeholder provides interface for Phase 3 integration. Main challenges were [X, Y, Z]. Overall: Framework is solid and ready for Phase 3 AI enhancement. Recommend implementing SessionManager history storage methods before full Phase 3 integration."
