## ‚úÖ Implementation Status

### Files Created
- [ ] `isaac/ai/task_planner.py` - Multi-step task execution (~200 lines)
- [ ] `isaac/models/task_history.py` - Task logging model (~100 lines)

### Files Modified
- [ ] `isaac/core/command_router.py` - Added task mode detection (~5 lines)

- [ ] 5 recovery options implemented (auto-fix, retry, skip, abort, suggest)
- [ ] Task history logging working
- [ ] All task commands routed through tier system

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

**Functional:**
- [ ] "isaac task: [description]" triggers task mode
- [ ] Task plans generated with AI
- [ ] 3 execution modes work correctly
- [ ] Steps execute through tier system (safety)
- [ ] Tier 3+ commands prompt for validation
- [ ] Failure recovery shows 5 options
- [ ] Task history logs all tasks
- [ ] Task history logs all steps with status
- [ ] No crashes on task failure

**Execution Modes:**
- [ ] Autonomous - executes all without prompts
- [ ] Approve-once - prompts once before execution
- [ ] Step-by-step - prompts for each step

**Recovery Options:**
- [ ] Auto-fix option available (may be partial implementation)
- [ ] Retry works
- [ ] Skip works
- [ ] Abort stops task
- [ ] Suggest option available (may be partial implementation)

**Safety:**
- [ ] All task commands go through CommandRouter
- [ ] Tier validation enforced
- [ ] Dangerous commands show AI warnings
- [ ] User can abort at any time

**Ready for Production:** [YES/NO]

## üìù Notes for Future Work

**Phase 3.6 Dependencies:**
- Task failure logs available for learning
- Recovery patterns can be analyzed
- Auto-fix placeholder ready for AI enhancement

**Improvements Needed:**
- Auto-fix AI implementation (currently falls back to retry)
- Suggest mode AI implementation (currently falls back to skip)
- Task rollback/undo capability
- Better error context for recovery suggestions

**Task Mode Observations:**
- [User experience notes]
- [Performance notes]
- [AI planning accuracy]
