dependencies:
  required:
    - "Phase 3.1 complete (ClaudeClient.correct_typo() working)"
    - "claude_api_key in ~/.isaac/config.json"
    
success_criteria:
  - "Tier 2: 'grp file' → auto-corrects to 'grep file' and executes"
  - "Tier 2.5: 'find -nam test' → suggests 'find -name test' and confirms"
  - "High confidence (>0.8) → auto-correct"
  - "Low confidence → execute as-is or ask user"
  - "AI disabled → tier system works without correction"

files_to_create:
  - "isaac/ai/corrector.py (~80 lines)"

files_to_modify:
  - "isaac/core/command_router.py - Tier 2 section (lines 64-68)"
  - "isaac/core/command_router.py - Tier 2.5 section (lines 70-81)"

total_lines: "~90 lines (80 new + 10 modified)"

safety_notes:
  - "Only correct with confidence > 0.8"
  - "User always sees correction (Tier 2.5)"
  - "Original command preserved in logs"
  - "Graceful degradation if AI unavailable"
