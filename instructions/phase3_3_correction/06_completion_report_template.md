## üìã Report Template

**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Implementer:** [Agent Name/Version]  
**Duration:** [Actual hours spent]

## ‚úÖ Implementation Status

### Files Created
- [ ] isaac/ai/corrector.py - Correction logic (~80 lines)

### Files Modified
- [ ] isaac/core/command_router.py - Tier 2 section (auto-correct + execute)
- [ ] isaac/core/command_router.py - Tier 2.5 section (correct + confirm)

### Integration Complete
- [ ] Tier 2 auto-correction working
- [ ] Tier 2.5 correction + confirmation working
- [ ] Confidence thresholds set (0.8 for Tier 2, 0.7 for Tier 2.5)
- [ ] Graceful degradation if AI disabled
