I would like to fix this 'header' section.
But I would like to now make THIS, the /status command

This is currently an example of the /status output

$> /status
Session: unknow | Cloud: ✓ | AI: ✓ | History: 42
$>


But if we were to replace the initial loaded 'header' with something like this.

Which we could then build out to add a few more system checks on-load, after the commands load.
for example

$>

and then this is what we can use for both the /status command and the initial header 

so using /status. will bring up this 'status header'

$>/status

$>

The thinking is because eventually it will do more. It will check messages on load.
It will check emails on load.
It will load daemons on load.
there will be more stuff to display.

so lets make it neat and tidy.

### When the header width is decided you must use
## strict enforcement on the status header width then.----->
============================================================

We do not want it too big, or mismatched per line, on length

You can add to the length if need be. But do not make it too wide, like the following example.

========================================================================================================================

twice as large, like the above example, is way too much


a length of 10 or so more is about all I am willing to accept.

=======================================================================

But only use it, if need be. Otherwise I would prefer it tidy.

But I do not want it. shorter than our current width.

### Remember *When the header width is decided* you must use
## strict enforcement on the status header width then. ---->
